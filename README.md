# CS 1.2: Intro to Data Structures

## Course Description

A course that looks under the hood at data structures and algorithms to see how they work. In addition to implementing these structures in an application; students will build them from scratch, analyze their complexity, and benchmark their performance to gain an understanding of their tradeoffs and when to use them in practice.

## Course Specifics

**Course Delivery**: online | 7 weeks | 14 sessions

**Course Credits**: 3 units | 37.5 Seat Hours | 75 Total Hours

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:
1.   Create Python programs that read and write text files and manipulate strings
2.   Implement core data structures including singly linked lists and hash tables
4.   Construct and sample probability distributions based on observed word frequencies
6.   Use unit tests that assert correct behavior of functions and classes
7.   Analyze the complexity of iterative algorithms and data structures with visual loop counting

## Prerequisites

Students must pass the following course and demonstrate mastery of its competencies:
